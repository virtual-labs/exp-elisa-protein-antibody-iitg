### About the Experiment 

Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA) exploit the specificity of antibodies to detect and quantify antigens or antibodies in a sample by utilizing an enzymatic reaction. The most commonly used form of EIA is the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In an ELISA, an enzyme is conjugated to an antibody or antigen, which then interacts with a colorless substrate to produce a colored product. This substrate, known as a chromogenic substrate, allows for the visual or spectrophotometric detection of the immune reaction.
